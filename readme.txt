Embed a StreamSend sign up form to your website: users will sign up from your own website instead of from the StreamSend website.

== Description ==

__Add a StreamSend Signup Form to Your Website__

Easily add a StreamSend Sign-up Form to your website with this plugin. When users sign up for your StreamSend newsletter, they will be signing up on *your website,* not on the StreamSend website.

<strong>Works well with the <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/show-content-only/">Show Content Only plugin</a></strong>. Used together, you can create a page that is _only the signup form_, but still running on WordPress.

<em>Note: this plugin requires an active <a href="http://www.streamsend.com/" rel="nofollow">StreamSend account</em>.

== Installation == 

1. Find the Sign up URL of the form you would like to add to your website by visiting your <a href="http://app.streamsend.com/forms" rel="nofollow">StreamSend Account Forms page</a>.

1. Paste the form's Sign up URL in your page or post, like this: `[streamsend url="http://app.streamsend.com/public/example/sample/subscribe"]`. The form will be inserted as designed in the StreamSend account.
